            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <b>Apple</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Software Engineer</li>
                March 2017 - November 2020
                <p></p>
                <li>Software Cartographer</li>
                June 2014 - March 2017
                <p>
                    I was on the Cartography team where we worked on the design of the map. During this time, we released several large styling updates including the initial releases of the transit map mode, maps on the Apple Watch, CarPlay Maps, and MapKit on Apple TV.
                    Part of my time was spent styling the map, and the other part of my time was spent building the infrastructure and tools behind the map styling.

                <li>GIS Analyst</li>
                October 2012 - June 2014
                <p>
                    I worked on the data team doing large scale data evaluation. I spent some of my time analyzing data sets of points and polygons for accuracy and completeness and the other part of my time building tools to help others do this work faster.

            <b>Land Cover & Surface Climate Group - Boston University</b>

                <li>Research Associate</li>
                January 2012 - August 2012
                <p>
                    During my final year at Boston University, I joined the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/lcsc/">Land Cover & Surface Climate Group</a> where I helped maintain and improve the training data for the <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov">MODIS</a> land cover product.
                    I built a tool to help manage the training data and I produced several charts to analyze the quality of the training data.

                Summer 2011
                <p>
                    I spent a summer working for <a href="https://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/peop/rama.php">Ramakrishna Nemani</a> exploring how the <a href="https://www.nas.nasa.gov/projects/nex.html">NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)</a> could be
                    used by undergraduate earth science students. I also produced a report on how crowd sourcing could be used in remote sensing research.
